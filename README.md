We are team of two people: Serikzhan Sadakbayev and Derrick

We are selecting Predicting Housing Prices (Linear Regression) topic.

For now, we are planning to use regression analysis to predict future housing prices, using different independent variables, that affect that market. Also we want to add mechanism that would make changes to our variables and correct them in case prediction of a housing prices wasnâ€™t correct. 

First we download data set into computer using a link to raw data from git. We use 'requests' in order to download a data.
Then we import pandas and put our data into the dataframe.
Our aim is to see what highly affects on the price of houses, so we want to see correlation between sales price and other factors, so we use corr function to see it, then the result we sort values by SalesPrice column. Here we can see the following high correlations with sale price. The highest among all is OverallQual, which has 79% of correlation.
