We are team of two people: Serikzhan Sadakbayev and Chao Du

We are selecting Predicting Housing Prices (Linear Regression) topic.

For now, we are planning to use regression analysis to predict future housing prices, using different independent variables, that affect that market. Also we want to add mechanism that would make changes to our variables and correct them in case prediction of a housing prices wasnâ€™t correct.
